#### Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis
1) Create a PTSD diagnosis variable 
   a. See the following links as useful resources to the PTSD checklist and respective variable coding and a guide to the scoring and diagnosis of PTSD using this checklist
   b. What is the prevalence of PTSD in this sample? How does this compare to other estimates of PTSD in military populations? 
2) Stratify the sample on medication information and compare prevalence of PTSD in these two segments of the sample    
   a. Does there appear to be a group with a higher prevalence?
   b. How would you visually convey this information to “non-technical expert”? Create this visual
3) Create suicidality variable
   a. See the following article containing the PHQ9 questions. The 9th question in PHQ9 is often used to assess suicidality, with any values >1 (i.e. present symptom) indicating suicidal endorsement
 
#### Build your model
* Fit your model to testing set 
   * How many incidents of SRB do we see? What about mitigation of PTSD symptom reporting?
