## Management & Maintenance Notes

### Updated: 10/20/2020

> #### Update: Updated document with removed future directions/next steps from student assessment document


## Notes

Need to add random forest and SVM, would at a minimum like to compare AUC values and 

Need to add SRB modelling also, right now it's just PTSD

## Medications

I wanted to include some writing about how I included different medications in the data simulation. I considered evidence as "low" or "moderate" for those medications recomended for the treatment of PTSD and attempted to sample the medications accordingly, such that those patients with reduced PTSD symptoms were more likely to be on moderate evidence than low evidence medications. I also included the list of medications with low evidence against PTSD treatment, notably some benzodiazepenes (specifically clonazepam and midazolam, among other medications highlighted in Noah and Will's presentation to the Summer 2020 session). Meications recommended against will be randomly sampled as well for PTSD treatment, but will also increase risk of suicidal ideation/SRB. 


> #### Remaining Possibe Changes:
> 1) PTSD diagnosis can be altered to be severity if we want every patient to "meet" the criteria for PTSD diagnosis
> 3) The visualization question for (2b) under Data Cleaning can be removed or fleshed out based on desired output of this use case
> 4) I've included PHQ9 based only on my own previous experience, but can always use other SRB measures or simply provide a binary suicidal endorsement variable 
> 5) Can also flesh out details on modelling (force students to use k-fold CV or a specific model) or leave it open-ended and leave students to their own devices
