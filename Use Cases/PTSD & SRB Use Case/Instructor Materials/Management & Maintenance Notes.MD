## Management & Maintenance Notes

### Updated: 10/20/2020

> #### Update: Updated document with removed future directions/next steps from student assessment document




> #### Notes:
> 1) PTSD diagnosis can be altered to be severity if we want every patient to "meet" the criteria for PTSD diagnosis
> 3) The visualization question for (2b) under Data Cleaning can be removed or fleshed out based on desired output of this use case
> 4) I've included PHQ9 based only on my own previous experience, but can always use other SRB measures or simply provide a binary suicidal endorsement variable 
> 5) Can also flesh out details on modelling (force students to use k-fold CV or a specific model) or leave it open-ended and leave students to their own devices
