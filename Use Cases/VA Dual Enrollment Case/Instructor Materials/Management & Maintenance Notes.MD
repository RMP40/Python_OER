Future directions include:
  Building in a mortality status variable. Students would then have to identify and could build simple classification models to predict mortality status. The goal would be to have mortality reduced for patients who are dual enrolled but **who do not** receive multiple opioid prescriptions, but significantly elevated for those with dual prescriptions and those with 120+ mg morphine equivalents. The take-home bein that dual-enrollment of healthcare can be a positive when the systems communicate and reduce risks of over-prescription.
  
  Currently do not utilize the time-date information, but could further complicate/build out this use case by emulating Dr. Gellad's (30 day overlap) task
