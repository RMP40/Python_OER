#### Data Cleaning, Prep
1) Create opioid administration outcome variable of interest within each data frame
2) Standardize coding of relevant variables between VA and CMS data sources
    a) Height
    b) Weight
    c) Dose Value (by daily intake)
3) Merge data frames together
    a) Identify individuals dually enrolled in VA and CMS healthcare systems 
4) Identify total, daily intake of mg morphine equivalents 
     a) Consider the sum of intake for patients that are "dually enrolled" 


#### Exploratory Analysis & Visualization
1) Compare rates of outcomes by those dual-enrolled and those enrolled in only the VA healthcare system
2) Create visual to demonstrate differences in outcomes between two classes of patients


<i>Outside of this basic visualization and data management, do we want to have students build a model? Could easily identify how important the dual enrollment feature is to mortality? Maybe it would be interesting to show the protective effect of dual enrollment BUT when overprescribed (which is more likely when dual enrolled), patients are extremely more at risk for overdose mortality and all-cause mortality. Importance of communication between healthcare systems</i>
