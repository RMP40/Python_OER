### Remaining Tasks: (additional tasks & project management contained on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/dlsFSVEO/python-oer-board)) 
1) Continued respository re-organization (and welcoming continued feedback!) 
2) Identifying and filling gaps in curated resources table and list below
3) Syncing resources between the list included below and the table
     a) These aggregations of OER's have some overlap and some materials present in only one of the two sources. In a perfect world both documents would be completely overlapping
4) Better connect curated resources/materials to use cases (including data sources and/or simulated data) *(likely a longer-term goal than the others listed)*  
5) Make this README a true orienting document/useful README for users, which I'll for now broadly classify as:  
    a) Students - Users I suspect will be looking for resources to supplement coursework  
    b) Naive Users - A catch-all for individuals seeking Python diddactics outside of a Pitt institutional course. This may include several subsets of people: those who have no Python experience, those looking to rekindle or supplement previous Python experience, and a specific group of individuals looking to learn Python prior to hte start of an applied Python/ML course
