This document simply contains remaining tasks, action items, or other management notes for the upkeep of this OER repository. 
 
### Remaining Tasks: (additional tasks & project management contained on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/dlsFSVEO/python-oer-board)) 
1) Continued respository re-organization (and welcoming continued feedback!) 
2) Continuing to fill gaps in the curated resources table and list below
3) Syncing resources between the list included below and the table
     a) These aggregations of OER's have some overlap and some materials present in only one of the two sources. In a perfect world both documents would be completely overlapping
