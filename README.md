## Python OER
### Python Education Resources, Use Cases, and Miscellaneous Didactic Materials
### Authors: Ravi Patel, Britney Stottlemeyer, Dominic DiSanto
### Initial Compilation: Summer 2020
### Version 0.02
### Last Update: 9/01/2020
 > #### Updated by: Dominic DiSanto
 > #### Update Notes: Updated README to move Resource-Table to separate document. Added Ravi's curated resource list to repository front-page 
 > #### Note: In moving the list from Ravi's *Python OER - Curated Resource List/Planning* document, I omitted the following sections which did not contain links but rather what seemed like notes to self or bullet points as placeholders for use cases. I can add these sections though if we'd like to see them here still, even as placeholders or with information about the use cases!

### Remaining Tasks: (see Trello for more complete outline) 
 1) Clean up the Python resource list and ensure links work
 1) Figure out repository organization (and welcome continued feedback) 
 2) Identifying and filling gaps in curated resources table  
 3) Better connect curated resources/materials to use cases (including data sources and/or simulated data) *(likely a longer-term goal than the others listed)*  
    a) Includes sync'ing resources between the list below and the resource-table in the additional markdown document
 4) Make this README a true orienting document/useful README for users, which I'll for now broadly classify as:  
    a) Students - Users I suspect will be looking for resources to supplement coursework  
    b) Naive Users - A catch-all for individuals seeking Python diddactics outside of a Pitt institutional course. This may include several subsets of people: those who have no Python experience, those looking to rekindle or supplement previous Python experience, and a specific group of individuals looking to learn Python prior to hte start of an applied Python/ML course
5) Additional tasks for use-case generation and storage (not directly relevant to this document but relevant to ongoing OER curation)   
6) Ensure tasks are linearly separated between Trello project management and GitHub project management
7) Ensure all relevant notes for management/maintenance of the GitHub are located here (and in a useful and **concise** format)
