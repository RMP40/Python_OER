## Python OER
### Python Education Resources, Use Cases, and Miscellaneous Didactic Materials
### Authors: Ravi Patel, Britney Stottlemeyer, Dominic DiSanto
### Initial Compilation: Summer 2020
### Version 0.01
### Last Update: 8/28/2020
 > #### Updated by: Dominic DiSanto
 > #### Update Notes: Updated README, initialized respository and updated preliminary resources 

### Current Status
I've been undecisive with the organization of this repo, so I have outlined two ways that I think we may want to present the materials. I think it may be usefult to include both methods (simply as two different folders). Each folder would simply contain a number of markdown files listing/annotating resources

Need new information for a specific module? Or simply want to review blog posts or additional lectures for several or all topics form the course? Or do you simply need a reference page without wading through subfolders and the repository's in-depth organization? Each organizational structure could supplement different wants. The general ideas of organization that I have are:   
  `Module Oriented` - Each document will contains links and resources relevant to the topics listed. Files can be further expanded into folders if we want to contain specific use-cases, code, data sets, etc. in a folder for each section. I tried to organize these loosely along a compromise between the Spring '20 the Summer '20 session modules. These are obviously dynamic based on both initial feedback and ongoing user feedback.  
  `Medium Oriented` - Folders are organized specific to the medium of content, i.e. LinkedIn learning course, Textbook/Blog Post, Use Case, etc. Again the actual structuring of the documents within this branch is subeject to (very welcomed) feedback. Documents could also be expanded to folders if more files would need to be included. I foresee this possibly being of interest more to naive users or individuals hoping to learn Python who want to learn through a specific format (e.g. a user who simply wants a compliation of online reference textbooks or similarly a catalog of online course options). 
  
It may be that having a separate markdown document for each `topic` becomes unwieldy either because there is too much to convey in a single markdown doc. We could then have sub-folders for these sections (as mentioned above) with several files/resources. Alternatively if the number of markdown files is unwieldy and each is fairly concise, we could simply aggregate resources into two markdown files containing rundowns of the resources both Module- and Medium-oriented in separate files. 

### Remaining Tasks: (see Trello for more complete outline) 
 1) Figure out repository organization (and welcome continued feedback) 
 2) Identifying and filling gaps in curated resources  
      Including better filling out the table below (currently somewhat bare, I focused on reposting  the formatting)
 3) Better connect curated resources/materials to use cases (including data sources and/or simulated data) *(likely a longer-term goal than the others listed)*
 4) Supplement existing resources with additional information/resources  
    a) From Google Drive (Ravi Word Document, Dom Excel Sheet)  
    b) NaRae Han has resources for her course that are less curated, but would likely map well to our resources/modules
 5) Make this README a true orienting document/useful README for users, which I'll for now broadly classify as:  
    a) Students - Users I suspect will be looking for resources to supplement coursework  
    b) Naive Users - A catch-all for individuals seeking Python diddactics outside of a Pitt institutional course. This may include several subsets of people: those who have no Python experience, those looking to rekindle or supplement previous Python experience, and a specific group of individuals looking to learn Python prior to hte start of an applied Python/ML course
