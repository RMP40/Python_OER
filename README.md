## Python OER
### Python Education Resources, Use Cases, and Miscellaneous Didactic Materials
### Authors: Ravi Patel, Britney Stottlemeyer, Dominic DiSanto
### Initial Compilation: Summer 2020
### Version 0.01
### Last Update: 9/01/2020
 > #### Updated by: Dominic DiSanto
 > #### Update Notes: Updated README to move Resource-Table to separate document. Added Ravi's curated resource list to repository front-page 

### Remaining Tasks: (see Trello for more complete outline) 
 1) **Clean up the Python resource list and ensure links work**
 1) Figure out repository organization (and welcome continued feedback) 
 2) Identifying and filling gaps in curated resources table  
 3) Better connect curated resources/materials to use cases (including data sources and/or simulated data) *(likely a longer-term goal than the others listed)*  
    a) Includes sync'ing resources between the list below and the resource-table in the additional markdown document
 4) Make this README a true orienting document/useful README for users, which I'll for now broadly classify as:  
    a) Students - Users I suspect will be looking for resources to supplement coursework  
    b) Naive Users - A catch-all for individuals seeking Python diddactics outside of a Pitt institutional course. This may include several subsets of people: those who have no Python experience, those looking to rekindle or supplement previous Python experience, and a specific group of individuals looking to learn Python prior to hte start of an applied Python/ML course
5) Additional tasks for use-case generation and storage (not directly relevant to this document but relevant to ongoing OER curation)
