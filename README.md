### Current Status
I've created three branches of possible organization. None of these are mutually exclusive; that is all types of organization could be presented to students with a properly orientation document/ReadME, so that students have a choice between how they'd like to prefer content. Need new information for a specific module? Or simply want to review blog posts or additional lectures for several or all topics form the course? Or do you simply need a reference page without wading through subfolders and the repository's in-depth organization? Each organizational structure could supplement different wants. The general ideas of organization that I have are:   
  `module_org` - One of module-specific folders. Each document will contains links and resources relevant to the topics listed. Files can be further expanded into folders if we want to contain specific use-cases, code, data sets, etc. in a folder for each section. I tried to organize these loosely along a compromise between the Spring '20 the Summer '20 session modules. These are obviously dynamic based on both initial feedback and ongoing user feedback.  
  `medium_org` - Folders are organized specific to the medium of content, i.e. LinkedIn learning course, Textbook/Blog Post, Use Case, etc. Again the actual structuring of the sub-folders within this branch is subeject to (very welcomed) feedback. This branch simply presents a different  
 
 
### Remaining Tasks:
 1) Figure out repository organization (w/ feedback from Britney/Ravi) 
 2) Identifying and filling gaps in curated resources
 3) Better connect curated resources/materials to use cases (including data sources and/or simulated data) 
 4) Supplement existing resources with additional information/resources  
    a) From Google Drive (Ravi Word Document, Dom Excel Sheet)  
    b) NaRae Han has resources for her course that are less curated, but would likely map well to our resources/modules
 5) Make this README a true orienting document/useful README for users/students
