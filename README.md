### Remaining Tasks:
 1) Figure out repository organization
 2) Identifying and filling gaps in curated resources
 3) Better connect curated resources/materials to use cases (including data sources and/or simulated data) 
 4) Supplement existing resources with additional information/resources  
    a) From Google Drive (Ravi Word Document, Dom Excel Sheet)  
    b) NaRae Han has resources for her course that are less curated, but would likely map well to our resources/modules
